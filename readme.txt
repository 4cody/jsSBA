This project is themed around drones.

It highlights the use of flex-box and grid layouts, in addition to using html tables.

Javascript is used to aggregate the inputs from the survey inot a single object for use.

There is a form ready to accept user credentials that is currently not 'wired up' but can
be in short order to send information to the back-end.

I chose a basic color pallete with complemeting tones.

On the 'home' page there is currently some information sections that contain drone footage
plaing on a loop.

The landing page has an image as the background with a over-lay to darken it.

The landing CTA has a blur effect for it's background.
